### Hi, I'm Megha 👋
I merge **wet-lab intuition** with **computational wizardry** to explore—and clearly communicate—the complexity of biological systems. I specialize in presenting large, complex datasets into **clean, intuitive visualizations** — my version of **runner’s high**. 

### Technical Arsenal
- **Languages:** **R** (tidyverse, DESeq2, Seurat), lean on **Python** when my workflows demand it, **Unix, HPC/SLURM and Nextflow**.
- **Omics Expertise:** Single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Multi-omics Integration, TCGA/ENCODE Mining
- **Infrastructure:** Nextflow, HPC (SLURM), Git/GitHub
- **Specialties:** Predictive ML for Genomics, Data Visualization, Genomic Imprinting

### I’m currently...
- Developing scalable workflows for **non-classical food allergy** research.
- Deepening my expertise in **Deep Learning for Genomics** at NYU.

**Fun fact:** When not in the lab, I lead **STEM & postdoc communities**, champion **women and international postdocs**, read **fiction** voraciously, and bring **main-character energy** to dance and stage performances.
