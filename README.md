## Hi there 👋

- I am a **molecular biologist turned computational biologist** with expertise in **genomics, transcriptomics**, and **multi-omics data integration** — basically anything with way too many rows and columns.  
- I am an **inquisitive learner** who taught myself **R**, starting with online courses and tutorials and building scripts that actually worked.  
- During my PhD, I analyzed **TCGA** and **ENCODE** datasets to study **imprinted microRNA clusters** in cancers, using **predictive ML algorithms** to do the heavy lifting.  
- I now analyze **bulk and single-cell RNA-seq** and **ATAC-seq** to uncover regulatory mechanisms in **non-classical food allergies**.  
- I have developed a knack for presenting large, complex datasets into **clean, intuitive visualizations** — my version of **runner’s high**.  
- I primarily use **R** (tidyverse, DESeq2, Seurat) and lean on **Python** when my workflows demand it, building reproducible **bioinformatics pipelines** using **Unix, HPC/SLURM and Nextflow**.  
- Currently juggling an **MS in Bioinformatics at NYU**, continuing my habit of learning new things.
- My long-term plan — merge **wet-lab intuition** with **computational wizardry** to explore—and clearly communicate—the complexity of biological systems.  

**Fun fact:** When not in the lab, I lead **STEM & postdoc communities**, champion **women and international postdocs**, read **fiction** voraciously, and bring **main-character energy** to dance and stage performances.
